                 <h2 style="text-align: center"> Applications </h2>
                   <p>You should complete this part of the coursework using the android studio development
                      environment, as is installed on the lab computers. You are free to use a physical android device,
                      with hardware debugging enabled to debug your application if you wish, but marking will be
                      conducted in the android emulator (i.e. your screencast must be of the emulator) so I would
                      recommend using that instead. The emulator should be configured to emulate a Google Nexus
                      phone, running API 21, Android 5.0 (Lollipop).
                      The app you develop will be similar to the contacts app we all have in our smart phones today as
                      illustrated in figure 2, except your app will display employee information. The scenario is that
                      you are developing this app for the manager of a company that needs to have up to date
                      employee information to hand at all times.
                      With this in mind your app should at the very least connect to the RESTful web service that you
                      created in Java in order to retrieve the employee JSON data. The app should then parse the
                      JSON data appropriately and display it on screen in an appropriate way (i.e. ListView).
                   </p>
              </div>
       
          <div class="content-2">
              <img src="images/phone.png" alt="Mobile Application" class="imgPhone"/>
              <h2 style="text-align: center">Code and Visual Quality (10%)</h2>
                   <p>At a very minimum your app should display the name and email of all employees in the
                      database. The better apps will have well thought out layout and style and display additional
                      information to the user about the employees such as job title, salary etc. The overall look and
                      design is up to you. The images/icons should be scaled appropriately, and the app should look
                      reasonably well polished (sensibly laid out, readable text, standard contrasting text, icons
                      and background colours colours). Your code should be sensibly designed, laid out
                      consistently and well commented.
                   </p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center">Server</h2>
                <p>Include some way of adding new employee information to the database. This can be achieved
                   by adding another route to the HTTP server (e.g. http://localhost:8005/add_emp) which outputs
                   an html form that can be filled and submitted by the user.
                   Once submitted the server will need an additional route (e.g.
                   http://localhost:8005/process_emp) which will process the data submitted by the user through
                   the html form and add it to the SQLite database.
                   Android App
                   The tasks of talking to the server to retrieve data can sometimes take some time to complete.
                   Leaving your appâ€™s interface locked up whilst it performs this task is hardly going to enhance the
                   user experience! In addition to this making network calls on the main app thread is not desirable
                   in the app development world.
                   Improve matters by handling the network calls that retrieve the data from your java server using
                   the AsyncTask class, which will perform them in a new thread in the background. Remember
                   to remove the StrictMode workaround discussed in lectures once threading is working.</p>
